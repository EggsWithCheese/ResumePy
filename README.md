# ResumePy

Author: Colin Leong

Side project to create a flexible resume builder/generator.

The general idea is: autogenerate resume from data files describing work history, etc. To change the look of the resume, just change the template. To change the content of the resume, change the data files. 

Currently thinking .csv files, and LaTeX output. All you have to do is update the CSV and run the thing again, and you have a LaTeX file ready to compile to PDF.

Yes, this will be way more work for me than just manually making it. But for _other_ people it might be cool.
