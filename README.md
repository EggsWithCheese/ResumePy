# ResumePy

The idea is, give it a CSV of your work history, educational experience, and other info, and a LaTeX template, and it'll autogenerate a resume. 

All you have to do is update the CSV and run the thing again, and you have a LaTeX file ready to compile to PDF.

Yes, this was way more work than just manually making it.
